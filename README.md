# Ruby Chess


    A command line chess game.  
      
    You can either play this game locally if you have ruby installed, or play it on my repl.it.  
      
    I have a live version on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@runafter/ShamelessWrathfulIntegrationtesting) available at https://repl.it/@runafter/ShamelessWrathfulIntegrationtesting
      
    If you play on repl.it, in the command line on the right, type "cd lib", then hit "enter". Then type "ruby game.rb".  
      
    If you play on locally, in the command line, navigate to chess/lib then type "cd lib", then hit "enter". Then type "ruby game.rb".  
      
    The game should allow you to play through. If you're playing locally, you can save the game at any time. I did this usling yaml.
